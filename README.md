# scala-fizzbuzz
This is a simple FizzBuzz Scala implementation (one description can be found at http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FizzBuzzTest).
It was developed with the purpose of just providing a quick dip study base for getting myself re-acquainted with Scala.
I've decided not to make use of overly complex one-liner lines (at least for the time being) as to allow a more paced read.
Commit history should reflect major changes I've made to use one of the available features in Scala, thus allowing for a progressive change to adapt it more towards a (I hope) more functional style.
